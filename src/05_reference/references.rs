    References:
    - mutable reference:
        let ref = &mut var;
    - immutable reference:
        let ref = &var;

    Note: You can only create a single mutable reference to a variable within a particular scope.
    If you're only working with regular immutable references, then you can create as many of those as you want pointing to the same variable. 
    The restriction comes in when you try to create references in addition to the one allowed mutable reference. 
    Even if those additional references are immutable, it creates the potential for problems and the Rust compiler will not allow it.
